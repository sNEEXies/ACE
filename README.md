# ACE
A collection of 3d files to use with the ACE Virtual Reality platform

None of the files provided are firearms or could be turned into one. 
These are simply hollow prop shells made for a Meta Quest VR controller to be housed in.

I recommend printing upside down with supports. It uses the least amount of supports.

Special thanks to
